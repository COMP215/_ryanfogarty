PROGRAMMER: RYAN FOGARTY

*I was not able to get the Krukals algorithm to work because the way I implemented my graph, every edge
is unaware of its corresponding vertexes so it just doesnt work out. I essentially create a new node
every time for an edge even if that edge already exists so thats the problem.

*I was not able to work with my group on the Prims algorithm 

*Naming scheme isnt on point because I didnt know this was a project when I was writing this

*My main is included in the Graph.cpp. Everything else (bipartate, dotgraph, etc) works 

*When compiled and run this project will create 2 txt files with a dot graph of the actual graph
and a dot graph of the not working Kruskal tree.
